# Learning about Version Control
- Author: Cynthia Limantono
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like that we get used to merge conflicts 
because it does not seem as hard as it sounds anymore.

I find that it's annoying to have multiple people working 
in the same project at the same time, but we just need to learn
to work and collaborate well in a team!
